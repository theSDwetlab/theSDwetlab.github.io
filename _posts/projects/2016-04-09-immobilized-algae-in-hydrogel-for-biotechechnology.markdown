Micro-organisms immobilized in a hydrogel matrix have a wide range of biotechnological applications including biosensors, wastewater filtration, and production of valuable compounds. For routine culture maintenance immobilization also offers advantages over traditional methods. We are exploring techniques for immobilization of microalgae and novel hydrogel geometries, including supported films and 3D printed structures.
