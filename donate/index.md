The Wet Lab is a not-for-profit community organized and operated lab. 

All of our equipment has been donated by lab members and participants in the broader DIYBio community which helps each other with materials, reagents, biological parts, equipment, protocols and knowledge. If you have equipment or supplies to donate, please contact Cameron Clarke at **sdwetlab@gmail.com**. If you would like to make a monetary donation of $5 or more, please visit our (old) Paypal donation site **<a href="http://wetlab.org/donation.html">here</a>**. Please note our memberships are $35/month rather than the $25/month listed on that donation page.
