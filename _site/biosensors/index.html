This is a multi-disciplined project to build sensor electrodes capable of detecting lead in water and antibiotics in milk.</p>

<p>The project relies on well-established electrochemical sensing techniques like square-wave and cyclic voltammetry.  These techniques work by detecting changes in the electrical properties that occur when the analyte of interest comes in contact with the sensor electrode surface.</p>

<p>We are engineering electrodes to specifically and sensitively detect analytes using simple chemical techniques like etching, drop-casting, and bonding recognition molecules to the electrode surface.</p>

<p>We are currently using the CheapStat potentiostat to make our measurements.  The CheapStat is an open source potentiostat created by Dr. Kevin Plaxco’s research group at UC Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>Eventually, after we have demonstrated feasibility with our electrode designs, we hope to acquire (or build!) a more sensitive potentiostat.</p>

<p>We are experimenting with two types of electrodes.  The first is a screen-printed electrode from Pine Research.  These small integrated electrodes include the three electrodes required for most electrochemical methods: working, counter, and reference electrode components.  The working electrodes can be modified using drop casting.</p>

<p>We are also developing our own custom 3-electrode systems.  We have several glassy carbon rods and gold foil for use as working electrodes. We are going to build our own Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, and we have some platinum wire for counter electrodes in these systems.</p>
