The Wet Lab is the only DIYBio Citizen Science facility in San Diego. We are a community of professional and citizen scientists who share a common interest in biology, and making cutting edge biotechnology accessible to everyone from all walks of life. Through our collaborative efforts, knowledge sharing, and broad participation, we intend to develop open source protocols with our global community. We are located at the Fab Lab in Makers Quarter.
